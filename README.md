### Project Overview
In this project the decision tree algorithm for the Banknote Authentication 
Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is implemented. 
The decision trees can be visualized as well as the Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports.
You can also visualize the Feature Importances
### Requirements
The requirements to run the code is Libraries and the file that has the dataset. If you want to run the code on another platform ypu may need to download the included libraries. Also you can download the data f,le from this link: [Download Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication)
### Customization options
You may customize the code by changing the specifications to see which one works better.
You may change: the measures of impurity (gini or entropy), maximum depth and minimum split variables to see different combinations
### Run the Code
To run the code you don't need anything other than the main requirements mentioned above
